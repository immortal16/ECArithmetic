# ECArithmetic

Ð¡ontains basic functions of elliptic curves arithmetic: doubling a point, addition of two points, scalar multiplication and converting between affine/projective form.

## Including

- params -- set of parameters of P-192 curve from ECDSA;
- helpers -- egcd and modular multiplicative inverse;
- curve -- elliptic curve class;
- point -- affine and projective point classes, contains all described functions;
- main -- simple proof of correctness with P-192 point.
